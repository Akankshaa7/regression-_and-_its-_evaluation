        "--->If I am a data scientist predicting **house prices** based on **area**, **number of rooms**, and **location**, and I noticed **heteroscedasticity** and **multicollinearity** in my model, here’s how I would handle it:\n",
        "\n",
        "First, to deal with **heteroscedasticity** (unequal spread of errors), I would start by checking the residual plots to confirm the problem. Then, I’d try a few fixes. One common solution is to **transform the dependent variable** — for example, taking the **log of house prices** often helps make the spread of errors more uniform. If that doesn’t work, I might use **Weighted Least Squares (WLS)** or **robust standard errors** so that the model gives less importance to points with higher error variance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, for **multicollinearity** (when two or more predictors are strongly correlated with each other), I would calculate the **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)** to identify which variables are causing the issue. If two variables, like “area” and “number of rooms,” are highly correlated, I might **remove one**, **combine them** (e.g., create “area per room”), or use **dimensionality reduction techniques** such as **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**. Another option is to use **regularization methods** like **Ridge** or **Lasso regression**, which can reduce the impact of multicollinearity by penalizing large coefficients.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, after making these changes, I would **rebuild and test the model** again to make sure the issues are resolved and that the predictions are stable and accurate.\n",
